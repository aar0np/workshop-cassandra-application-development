# Java instructions

### Setup

First (in the GitPod terminal) `cd java`.

Execute a `mvn clean install` to bring in the dependent packages and build everything.

The connection classes are `AstraConnection.java` and `CassandraConnection.java`.  The `AstraConnection` class extends the `CassandraConnection` super class, accounting for the Astra DB environment variables.  Take a minute to give those a look:
 - [AstraConnection](AstraConnection.java)
 - [CassandraConnection](CassandraConnection.java)

### Run stuff

ðŸ’» Run connectivity test:
```bash
java -jar target/examples-0.0.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```
<details><summary>Show expected result</summary>

```
$> java -jar target/examples-0.0.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar
[OK] Success
[OK] Welcome to Astra DB! Connected to Keyspace sensor_data
** Connected to cluster 'cndb' at data center 'us-east1' **
```

_Note: You may see warnings for SLF4J.  These can be safely ignored._
